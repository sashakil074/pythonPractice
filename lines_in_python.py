#. Write a Python program to define the following variables:
#course = 'Python', version = 3.8, duration = 120 (hour) using:
#a. Single-line statement
#b. Multi-statement in one line

#a. Single-line statement
course = 'Python'
version = 3.8
duration = 120
print(course)
print(version)
print(duration)

#b. Multi-statement in one line

course = 'Python';version = 3.8;duration = 120;print(course);print(version);print(duration)

#. Write a Python program to create a list with elements (1, 2, 43, 9) in two ways:
#a. In one line
#b. In multiple lines

#a. In one line

l=[1,2,43,9]

print(l)
print(type(l))

#b. In multiple lines
l=[1,
   2,
   43,
   9]
print(l)
print(type(l))
